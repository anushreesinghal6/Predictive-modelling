# Predictive-modelling

Description:

it is a project focused on developing an interpretable predictive model for
mental health disorders using historical social media data.
Employed state-of-the-art techniques such as BERT, Roberta, zero-shot learning, and few-shot learning to improve the accuracy of the model.
Collected and preprocessed social media data using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries to ensure data quality and relevance.
Trained and evaluated machine learning models on the preprocessed data, aiming to generate meaningful insights and predictions.
Explored Generative AI techniques, including leveraging GPT-3, to enhance the predictive capabilities of mental health disorder identification using historical social media data.
Emphasized the interpretability of the model's outcomes, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights into mental wellbeing patterns.
It has all the research papers which were referred. Codes with have been developed for using it for predict the mental health well being of the person.
